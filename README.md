###Project Overview:

   Develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood you would like to visit. Add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

###How to use the app

* Search box:

   Use the search box to find a neighborhood you want to visit. Type city name or district. The app will focus on that area and request the 10-20 most popular places in the area.

   You can filter the places returned by the search simple typing in the search box it will update the markers and the placelist on keydown (can search for name or type "bar, chinese restaurant, takeaway , sushi near Paris....").

* Place list:

   On the right you can find the places correspond to the markers. Clicking on the will focus the map on the place and will open an infowindow.
   You can hide the Place list with the hamburger button located on the top right corner.

* Humbuger button:

  This button is on the upper right corner of the Place list. Use it to hide or show the Place list. It is useful when the sÄ‰reen width is reduced.


* Button toolbar:

   This toolbar dynamically changes with the neighborhood. It will show the set of the markers returned be the search. If you press one of the icon it will re-request the search in the area with different category setting. For example if you have a coffee icon it will return the 10-20 most popular coffee-shop in the area.
   you can reset the search with the refresh button and it will clear the category filter and return the 10-20 most popular places in the area.
